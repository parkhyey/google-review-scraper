## Google Review Scraper Microservice
This microservice is live at https://google-review-scraper.herokuapp.com/ \
It provides Google reviews and star ratings scraped into a JSON string where the key ‘rating’ is the number of the star ratings and the key ‘text’ is the review text.

  e.g.)
```
[{"rating":5,"text":"We booked our Maldives honeymoon through Maldives Resorts and we were very pleased with it. They handed all our many questions and provided great accommodation for a good price."},
{"rating":5,"text":"loved It so much!!!!!! saw a couple of sharks. but it was bloody fantastic"}]
```
